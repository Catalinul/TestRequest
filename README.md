# TestRequest

Test Request is a web-based platform for submitting, retrieving and analysing test requests, both software and hardware.

Within it we have two main stakeholders:
- requesters, those who place test requests;
- testers, those who take and fulfill the requests.

Through it, requesters can send requests to testers. The testers will take requests, analyse the requirements, perform the requested test, and then upload the test results. The requester then has the option to accept the test results as final or they can come back with additional requirements if they are not satisfied or want something additional performed.

The Test Request platform also contains a part of analysis, reporting and notification (via email) on the tests performed.

I wrote the Test Request platform in PHP (for the back-end part), MySQL (for the database) and HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the front-end part).

The problem I wanted to solve with this software application is the lack of tools for someone who wants to start working on their own in the QA area.

The application is scalable and customizable, in the sense that it can be used by a small team of people who want to work in this area and can be modified to fit other areas of activities, not just QA.

I consider the app to be a prototype for a CRM-like platform, being scalable and customizable so that the stakeholder groups that have access to the app can be expanded, with minimal effort in terms of changes to the application.
